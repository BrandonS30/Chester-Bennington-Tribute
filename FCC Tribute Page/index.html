                <h2>Music Career</h2>
                <p>Chester Bennington was born March 20, 1976. He was an american singer, songwriter, musician, and actor. He was the lead vocalist of 4 different bands, Linkin Park, being the most well known, also Grey Daze, Dead by Sunrise and, between
                    2013 and 2015, Stone Temple Pilots. Chester is known as one of the best rock vocalist of his generation, maybe of all time. Bennington first gained prominence with the release of Linkin Park's debut album, Hybrid Theory released in
                    2000, which was a massive success. The album was rightfully certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2005.</p>
                <h2>Family and Health</h2>
                <p>Bennington had a son, Jaime (born May 12, 1996), from his relationship with Elka Brand. In 2006, he adopted Brand's other son, Isaiah (born November 8, 1997). He married his first wife, Samantha Marie Olit, on October 31, 1996. They had
                    one child together, Draven Sebastian (born April 19, 2002). Bennington's relationship with his first wife declined during his early years with Linkin Park, and they divorced in 2005. In 2006, he married Talinda Ann Bentley, a former
                    Playboy model with whom he had three children: Tyler Lee Bennington (born March 16, 2006) and twins Lily and Lila (born November 9, 2011).</p>
                <p>Bennington struggled with drug and alcohol abuse. Bennington overcame his drug addiction and would go on to denounce drug use in future interviews. In 2011, he said he had quit drinking, noting, "I just don't want to be that person anymore."
                    Bennington later battled an alcohol addiction during his tenure with Linkin Park, which he overcame following an intervention from his bandmates.</p>
                <p>Bennington was plagued with poor health during the making of Meteora, and struggled to attend some of the album's recording sessions. In the summer of 2003, he began to suffer from extreme abdominal pain and gastrointestinal issues while
                    filming the music video for "Numb" in Prague. He was forced to return to the United States for surgery, and filmed the remainder of the music video in Los Angeles.</p>
                <h2>Bennington's Death</h2>
                <p>At around 9:00 a.m. PDT on July 20, 2017, Bennington was found dead by his housekeeper at his home in Palos Verdes Estates, California. His death was ruled a suicide by hanging. Bandmate Mike Shinoda confirmed his death on Twitter, writing,
                    "Shocked and heartbroken, but it's true. An official statement will come out as soon as we have one." On July 21, Brian Elias, the chief of operations for the office of the medical examiner-coroner, confirmed that a half-empty bottle
                    of alcohol was found at the scene, but no other drugs were present. A toxicology report released in December reported "a trace amount" of alcohol in Bennington's system at the time of death. The band canceled the rest of their One
                    More Light Tour and refunded tickets. Following his death, Linkin Park took to a hiatus period until April 2020, when Dave Farrell revealed the band was working on new music.</p>
                <h2>Bennington's Legacy</h2>
                <p>Several publications have commented on the music legacy Bennington left with the bands and projects he worked in. While describing the success of Bennington and Linkin Park, Allmusic's Andrew Leahey said, "Although rooted in alternative
                    metal, Linkin Park became one of the most successful acts of the 2000s by welcoming elements of hip-hop, modern rock, and atmospheric electronica into their music ... focusing as much on the vocal interplay between singer Chester Bennington
                    and rapper Mike Shinoda". Writing for Billboard, Dan Weiss stated that Bennington "turned nu-metal universal," as he was "clearly an important conduit for his far-ranging audience". The New York Times' Jon Caramanica commented that
                    Bennington's ability to "pair serrated rawness with sleek melody" separated him from other contemporary singers, and also from the artists he was influenced by. Caramanica noted, "He was an emo sympathizer in a time when heavy metal
                    was still setting the agenda for mainstream hard rock, and a hip-hop enthusiast who found ways to make hip-hop-informed music that benefited from his very un-hip-hop skill set". As Bennington acquired influences from industrial and
                    hardcore punk acts, the journalist believed this was the factor that made Linkin Park survive the "rise and precipitous fall of the rap-rock era", calling the musician "a rock music polymath". Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times argued,
                    "Perhaps more than Linkin Park's influential sound, Bennington's real artistic legacy will be the message he put across – the reassurance he offered from the dark". BBC's Steve Holden called Bennington the "voice of a generation",
                    saying his voice was arguably Linkin Park's greatest asset. Jonathan McAloon of The Daily Telegraph commented, "Bennington’s death will have an impact on many millennials because his voice was the sound of their millennium". While
                    talking about Linkin Park's popularity, Corey Apar, of AllMusic, commented, "Bennington's oft-tortured vocals became one of the most distinctive in the alternative rock scene". Writing for The Guardian, Ben Beaumont-Thomas noted "Bennington’s
                    decision to sing clearly and openly was, therefore, more radical than he is given credit for, and indeed more socially valuable". The journalist continued to discuss Bennington's impact, commenting, "His cleanly articulated tales of
                    emotional struggle gave millions the sense that someone understood them, and the huge sound of his band around him magnified that sense, moving listeners from the psychic space of their bedrooms into an arena of thousands of people
                    who shared their pain".</p>
